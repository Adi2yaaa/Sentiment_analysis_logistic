# Sentiment_analysis_logistic
This project focuses on performing Sentiment Analysis using machine learning techniques to classify customer reviews as either positive or negative. Sentiment analysis, a key application of Natural Language Processing (NLP), helps in understanding public opinion, customer satisfaction, and brand perception by analyzing textual feedback.

In this project, a machine learning pipeline is built using TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction and Logistic Regression for classification. The goal is to train a model that can predict the sentiment of unseen reviews with high accuracy and interpretability.

ðŸ§  Objective
The primary aim is to:

Convert unstructured text data (customer reviews) into meaningful numerical features using TF-IDF.

Train a logistic regression model to classify the sentiments of reviews.

Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on real-world data using common metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset consists of customer reviews, each labeled with a sentiment (positive or negative). Each review is a raw text entry that expresses an opinion or feedback on a product, service, or experience.

Example format:

Review	Sentiment
"The product quality is amazing"	Positive
"Iâ€™m very disappointed"	Negative

You can use any open-source sentiment dataset, such as the IMDB Movie Reviews, Amazon Product Reviews, or a custom review dataset in .csv format.

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used
Python: The programming language used to write and execute code.

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code: For interactive coding and result visualization.

Pandas: To handle data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Scikit-learn:

TfidfVectorizer â€“ For converting text into numerical TF-IDF features.

LogisticRegression â€“ To train the sentiment classifier.

train_test_split, accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix â€“ For model evaluation and testing.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing confusion matrix and result metrics.

ðŸ§ª Model Building Steps
Data Preprocessing

Load the CSV file and clean the text (e.g., remove punctuation, lowercase, stopwords).

Encode the target sentiment labels to numerical values (e.g., 1 = Positive, 0 = Negative).

Feature Extraction

Apply TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text into numerical vectors that reflect the importance of words relative to the entire corpus.

Model Training

Use Logistic Regression, a fast and effective linear model, to learn patterns in the TF-IDF features that indicate sentiment.

Evaluation

Measure model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualize results using a confusion matrix.

âœ… Output & Results
The final notebook produces:

A trained model capable of predicting sentiment from raw text input.

TF-IDF vectorized data used for training and testing.

Performance metrics and visualizations.

Insights into which words or terms contributed most to predictions.

ðŸ“¦ Deliverables
A Jupyter Notebook with:

Preprocessing steps

Model building and training

Evaluation and visualization

Clean code with comments for easy understanding
